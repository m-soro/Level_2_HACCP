## The benefits of food safety

High standards of food safety bring important benefits to consumers, employees and business owners. A food business that has high standards of food safety will be complying with the law and is likely to have a good reputation.
* Customers - Food safety ensures satisfied and loyal customers.
* Food - Food safety reduces: 1) the risk of food poisoning 2) unnecessary waste and related costs.
* Employees - 1) better job security 2) a better place to work.

## Costs of poor food safety

Poor standards of food safety can result in significant costs.
* The food business could receive more customer complaints, which would lead to a bad reputation and a loss of profit.
* The business will have higher running costs because food has to be thrown away.
* Poor standards in food safety could lead to legal action and fines, loss of jobs and closure of the business.

## Food Poisoning - Symptoms and **'At risk'** groups

Food poisoning is caused by eating food contaminated with harmful bacteria or viruses, or by harmful substances such as poisonous plants, fungi, chemicals or metals. As soon as your body detects that you have eaten something harmful, it reacts to get rid of it and repair any damage. 

* As your body reacts to get rid of the contaminated food and repair any damage this can cause symptoms such as stomach cramps and diarrhoea.
* Food poisoning can also cause nausea and vomiting.
* As well as more common symptoms such as diarrhoea and vomiting, food poisoning can cause fever which is linked to infection and headaches which are brought on by dehydration linked to vomiting.

## Vulnerable groups
People who are most at risk from the effects of food poisoning are:

* babies and young children
* elderly people
* people who are ill or recovering from illness
* pregnant women and their unborn babies.

For various reasons, these people will suffer more, for example, their immune systems are not developed or working well enough to fight illness.

## Physical and Chemical Contamination

**What is a ‘contaminant’?**

A contaminant is any substance or object in food that can make food harmful or unpleasant. Contaminants are food safety hazards – that is, they have the potential to cause consumers harm or offence.

## Food safety hazards
There are three main types of food safety hazards caused by contaminants:

1. physical
2. chemical
3. biological.
In this module, we will look at physical, chemical and biological contaminants, where they come from and how to stop them getting into food.

**Physical contamination** is caused when objects end up in food. 
Physical contamination is both unpleasant (because it can be seen by the consumer, unlike most chemical or biological contamination) and can be harmful to health causing:

* broken teeth
* cuts in and around the mouth
* choking.

**Chemical contamination** is caused when harmful chemicals are accidentally added to food – for example, by excessive use of pesticides, incorrect quantities of additives, careless use of cleaning chemicals. This is a cause of food poisoning. If it is your job is to sanitize salad or fruit using chlorine-based tablets or liquids, it is vital to ensure that the instructions are followed exactly.

There have been a number of food poisoning incidents where chemical residues have remained on food and burned the mouths of consumers.

Chemical contamination can also be caused by metals – for example, when food comes into contact with unsuitable pans or containers or when soil and water is contaminated by industrial pollution and metals are absorbed by animals, fish or crops. In the short term, chemical contamination may cause severe vomiting, but in the long term, it may lead to serious illnesses – such as cancer – and damage to organs such as the liver, kidneys and brain.
