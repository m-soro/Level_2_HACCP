* The business will have higher running costs because food has to be thrown away.
* Poor standards in food safety could lead to legal action and fines, loss of jobs and closure of the business.

## Food Poisoning - Symptoms and **'At risk'** groups

Food poisoning is caused by eating food contaminated with harmful bacteria or viruses, or by harmful substances such as poisonous plants, fungi, chemicals or metals. As soon as your body detects that you have eaten something harmful, it reacts to get rid of it and repair any damage. 

* As your body reacts to get rid of the contaminated food and repair any damage this can cause symptoms such as stomach cramps and diarrhoea.
* Food poisoning can also cause nausea and vomiting.
* As well as more common symptoms such as diarrhoea and vomiting, food poisoning can cause fever which is linked to infection and headaches which are brought on by dehydration linked to vomiting.

## Vulnerable groups
People who are most at risk from the effects of food poisoning are:

* babies and young children
* elderly people
* people who are ill or recovering from illness
* pregnant women and their unborn babies.

For various reasons, these people will suffer more, for example, their immune systems are not developed or working well enough to fight illness.
