## Physical and Chemical Contamination

**What is a ‘contaminant’?**

A contaminant is any substance or object in food that can make food harmful or unpleasant. Contaminants are food safety hazards – that is, they have the potential to cause consumers harm or offence.

## Food safety hazards
There are three main types of food safety hazards caused by contaminants:

1. physical
2. chemical
3. biological.
In this module, we will look at physical, chemical and biological contaminants, where they come from and how to stop them getting into food.

**Physical contamination** is caused when objects end up in food. 
Physical contamination is both unpleasant (because it can be seen by the consumer, unlike most chemical or biological contamination) and can be harmful to health causing:

* broken teeth
* cuts in and around the mouth
* choking.

**Chemical contamination** is caused when harmful chemicals are accidentally added to food – for example, by excessive use of pesticides, incorrect quantities of additives, careless use of cleaning chemicals. This is a cause of food poisoning. If it is your job is to sanitize salad or fruit using chlorine-based tablets or liquids, it is vital to ensure that the instructions are followed exactly.

There have been a number of food poisoning incidents where chemical residues have remained on food and burned the mouths of consumers.

Chemical contamination can also be caused by metals – for example, when food comes into contact with unsuitable pans or containers or when soil and water is contaminated by industrial pollution and metals are absorbed by animals, fish or crops. In the short term, chemical contamination may cause severe vomiting, but in the long term, it may lead to serious illnesses – such as cancer – and damage to organs such as the liver, kidneys and brain.


## Sources of food poisoning

If you eat contaminated food, you are likely to suffer from food poisoning.

In addition to chemical contamination, food poisoning can be caused by:

* micro-organisms
* bacteria
* viruses
* moulds and fungi
* natural poisons in food itself.

Before we move on to examine micro-organisms in more detail, we will have a look at natural poisons that can occur in the food itself.

### Potatoes
The humble potato is an example of a food we eat on a daily basis that can contain poison. The chemical solanine can build up in green skins and sprouting tips. There are two ways to prevent solanine poisoning:

Store potatoes in dark, well-ventilated stores and make sure that any green patches and sprouting tips are cut right out of potatoes before they are cooked.

### Mushrooms and fungi can be deadly
Always ensure that mushrooms come from a reputable supplier.

### Red kidney beans can be poisonous
Uncooked or partly-cooked red kidney beans contain a chemical that produces very severe food poisoning symptoms if consumed.
Red kidney beans should be soaked for 12 hours and boiled for 90 minutes before they are consumed.

## What are micro-organisms?

‘Micro’ means small or tiny and ‘organism’ means a living thing. 

So, a micro-organism is a tiny living thing – so small that it is invisible to the naked eye.

There are two types of micro-organisms associated with food poisoning.

1. Bacteria
Bacteria are single-celled micro-organisms and the most common cause of food poisoning.

2. Viruses
Viruses are even smaller than bacteria and are carried on food and in water.

### Bacteria

### Contaminated raw food
Meat, poultry, eggs, fish, the outside of fruit and vegetables – every kind of raw food is likely to be contaminated with bacteria

There are risks associated with eating any food raw, but the risks can be controlled by ensuring that food is bought from reputable suppliers and then prepared with care.

**Rare beef**

Bacteria do not occur within the flesh of most animals (unless they are sick and then they would not be allowed in the human food chain).

Most of the bacteria associated with meat come from the guts and gut contents – from faeces. They get onto meat from contaminated equipment or surfaces when it is slaughtered, cut or butchered.

When a joint of beef is cooked, all the bacteria on the outside surfaces will be killed and, if you use a clean knife to slice the meat, it will be safe to eat, even if it is rare in the middle.

Burgers, however, are made from meat that has been minced and therefore has a great many cut surfaces (the same is true of sausages and other processed meat products). Contamination may have travelled through the product and you must ensure that it is thoroughly cooked all the way through to kill the bacteria that may be in the middle.

**Raw eggs**

The contamination of eggs with Salmonella occurs from two main sources:

* chicken faeces on the shell, and more importantly
* from bacteria that inhabit the chicken’s body where and when the eggs are formed.

Salmonella bacteria can be found in both the white and the yolk of the egg.

Suppliers should be carefully selected, so that that the eggs you use come from hens that are tested, vaccinated and confirmed Salmonella-free. Some foreign imports, which come from countries without proper Salmonella-screening schemes, have been associated with infection in recent years. Even when eggs come from trusted sources, they should never be given to vulnerable people without thorough cooking.

**Raw fish or shellfish**

Certain shellfish – including oysters, mussels and clams – can cause food poisoning. One of the reasons for this is that they are filter feeders and filter huge volumes of water to get food. If there are any bacteria or viruses in this water, they will concentrate in these filters. 

Raw fish or shellfish can be safe to eat. You need to find good sources, ideally from clean or treated water. This is particularly important for fish or shellfish, such as oysters, that are not cooked before eating which would kill any micro-organisms.

**Pests or pets**
Animals (such as rats, mice, dogs and cats) and insects (such as flies and cockroaches) all carry harmful micro-organisms on and in their bodies that can be easily transferred to food handlers and food. 

**Dirt and dust**

The air carries dirt and dust containing millions of microscopic particles of dead skin, food and other debris covered in bacteria that can settle on uncovered food.

**Food waste and refuse**

Bacteria from food waste (and from the pests that it can attract) can contaminate food if the waste is not disposed of properly.
This is why it is important to always wash hands after handling waste.

**People**

People – including food handlers, visitors and customers – carry bacteria. Bacteria live in huge quantities in our intestines and come out in faeces. This happens in everyone, not just people who are ill.
Bacteria are also found on skin, on hair and in the nose and mouth. Bacteria can, therefore, contaminate clothing.

### Are all bacteria harmful

Not all bacteria are harmful. In fact, we can divide them into three types:	
* **pathogenic** - Pathogenic bacteria include all the types that cause diseases. The term *‘pathogenic’* means *‘disease causing’*.
* **helpful** - There are some foods that would not exist without help from some bacteria.
* **spoilage** - Spoilage bacteria. Spoilage is the process by which food spoils or becomes unacceptable to eat. It is also known as decomposition, rotting, perishing, deteriorating and ‘going bad’.Spoilage bacteria are present in the environment and damage the quality of food and reduce its shelf life.

## Common Pathogenic Micro-organisms

### Seven pathogenic micro organisms
In this section we will look at **six pathogenic bacteria** and **one virus** that can cause food poisoning:

1. Campylobacter jejuni
2. Staphylococcus aureus
3. Bacillus cereus
4. Salmonella
5. E. coli O157
6. Clostridium perfringens
7. Norovirus.

### Campylobacter jejuni

Campylobacter jejuni is the most common cause of food poisoning in the UK.

It is commonly linked to:

* raw poultry
* meat
* unpasteurised milk.

Campylobacter jejuni causes quite severe symptoms – diarrhoea, stomach ache, nausea and fever – lasting anything from one to 10 days. These symptoms usually appear between two to five days after eating the contaminated food.

### Where does Staphylococcus aureus come from?

Staphylococcus aureus mainly comes from people and can be found on the skin of carriers (approximately one third of the population), particularly in cut or damaged skin, and also the nose, hair, ears and mouth.

Staphylococcus aureus is commonly linked to:

* any high risk food touched by hand
* cold meats
* unpasteurised milk
* dairy products

How does it cause illness?
Staphylococcus aureus causes food poisoning by producing a toxin within the food as bacteria multiply or die. Toxins are poisons produced by bacteria.

After eating contaminated food, the toxin causes stomach pain and vomiting usually within a couple of hours.

How do we control it?
Food handlers should cover any open skin wounds fully with waterproof dressings and practice good personal hygeine.

Ensure that the bacteria cannot multiply to unsafe levels in the food before it is eaten. Keeping food refrigerated will restrict both bacterial multiplication and toxin production.

### Bacillus cereus
Bacillus cereus is commonly linked to cereals **(especially rice)**. It has a special way of surviving unfavourable environments, by the formation of spores (you will learn more about spore formation later).

How does it cause food poisoning?
One type of Bacillus cereus food poisoning causes illness in a similar way to Staphylococcus aureus – by the formation of a toxin within the food. Again, the symptoms are mainly stomach ache and vomiting with a quick onset time.

A second type causes the formation of a toxin in the intestines and is more associated with diarrhoea. In this case, there is a longer onset period before the symptoms appear.

### Salmonella

Salmonella can be found in: human and animal guts, pests, sewage and contaminated food.

Salmonella is commonly linked to:

* raw and uncooked poultry
* raw eggs
* other raw meat.

Where does it come from?
Salmonella bacteria affect the intestines and stomach. They typically cause stomach pain, diarrhoea, vomiting and fever.

Salmonella food poisoning can be caused by affected people not washing their hands properly after going to the toilet and then touching and contaminating food.

Salmonella can be excreted by an infected person. Even when the symptoms of illness have gone, the person can remain a symptomless carrier.

How does it cause illness?
When these bacteria enter the affected person’s intestines, the body responds by expelling the infection – as diarrhoea.

How do we control it?
If a case of Salmonella food poisoning occurs, food handlers may be required to give faecal samples as part of the process of trying to identify the source of an outbreak.

As a food handler, you must tell your supervisor if you have food poisoning or the symptoms of food poisoning, even if it was while you were away from work and you think you have now recovered.

### E. coli

E. coli O157 is a very nasty bacterium that can be fatal, causing kidney failure, especially in children. The bacteria are found in the gut of animals, particularly cattle, and are commonly linked with beef (especially minced) and other meat, raw milk and untreated water.

In Wales in 2005 a boy of five died and 150 children and adults became ill, after eating ham and turkey sandwiches as part of school dinners. The source of the contamination was believed to be a vacuum-packing machine, which had been wrongly used by the meat supplier for both raw and cooked meats.

### Clostridium perfringens

Clostridium perfringens is found in the gut, dirt and soil and contaminates meat and poultry when animals and birds are slaughtered, cut and butchered.
It causes diarrhoea and abdominal pains 12–24 hours after being ingested. Clostridium perfringens is commonly linked to cooked meat and poultry.
It usually multiplies well in environments where there is little or no oxygen, so it is often linked with:

* stews
* rolled joints of meat
* other similar dense products.

Clostridium perfringens is another spore-forming bacterium.

### Norovirus
Norovirus is one of the most common causes of food poisoning.
Norovirus is found in the gut and in water that has been contaminated by sewage.

How does it cause illness?
It is transmitted by the faecal-oral route, and commonly involves:
*foods eaten raw such as
  * shellfish
  * vegetables
  * salads
  * fruit
* drinking unclean water.
 
Norovirus does not require food to survive and can be spread by air and contact with infected surfaces. This is why it spreads quickly in closed environments such as hospital wards, residential care homes, schools and cruise ships.

How do we control it?
Norovirus can be controlled by:
* thorough cooking
* avoiding risks of cross-contamination
* maintaining high standards of personal hygiene – especially hand washing
* maintaining high standards of cleaning
* taking care when buying and preparing shellfish to be served raw.

Symptoms of the illness
Norovirus causes vomiting, diarrhoea and abdominal pains, and sometimes headache (due to the loss of water from the body) and fever, 24–48 hours after being consumed.

### Other food borne viruses
Norovirus is the most common food-borne virus, but there are others.

* **Hepatitis A** can also be spread by infected food and water. The resulting illness can vary from vomiting and nausea to liver damage
* **Rotavirus** is also a significant food-borne virus causing thousands of cases of intestinal disease, particularly in children under the age of five.
