## Multiplication of Bacteria

Bacteria are the most common cause of food poisoning. Bacteria multiply by a process known as **binary fission** (dividing in two) – one bacterium becomes two bacteria, two become four, four become eight and so on. Under ideal conditions, bacteria can double every 10 to 20 minutes.

**Binary fission**
Just suppose that there was one harmful bacterium in a chicken sandwich at 9 am, and that bacterium became two bacteria by 9.15 am and this process of multiplication continues every 15 minutes until 2 pm – in the end there would be over one million in the sandwich.

### Conditions for multiplication

* **time** - Under ideal conditions, bacteria can double every 10 to 20 minutes.
* **warmth** - Bacterial multiplication occurs fastest in the **‘danger zone’– between 5°C and 63°C**.
* **moisture** - Bacteria cannot multiply without moisture. This is one of the reasons why, in kitchens, the sink and its surrounding area often have high levels of bacteria.
* **nutrient source** - Bacteria generally thrive in and on protein-based foods – for example, meat, eggs, dairy products – but they can survive for days on even a thin film of dirt or a dry drop of meat juice. 

## What killed Clostridium botulinum?

You have already learned about Clostridium perfringens. This bacterium has a relative, called **Clostridium botulinum**, which causes a severe, often fatal, type of food poisoning known as **botulism**. Clostridium botulinum is found in soil and water and can be linked to fish, meat and vegetables. How do we ensure that food is free of this pathogenic micro-organism?

### Spores

**Bacteria like Clostridium botulinum, Clostridium perfringens and Bacillus cereus, all have a similar way of surviving**.

They produce spores, which are a bit like seed pods, to protect the bacteria from harsh environments such as high temperatures (for example, cooking) and chemicals. It takes **very high temperatures (more than 121ºC) to kill spores**.

During the canning process, tins are filled, sealed and then heated with additional pressure to destroy any Clostridium botulinum bacteria and their spores.

### Controlling spore-forming bacteria

When any food containing bacterial spores has been cooked at normal temperatures and re-enters the danger zone as it cools, the spores turn back into bacteria, and can then begin to multiply.

Food must be kept out of the danger zone as much as possible. **Hot food should be kept hot (above 63°C)** and **cold food cold (below 5°C)**

If you want to store food following cooking, it should be cooled as quickly as possible (to 5°C or less within one to two hours) and then put in the fridge in a covered container.

### High-risk foods
High-risk foods are those that are most likely to cause food poisoning. High-risk foods are usually:

* ready to eat
* moist
* high in protein.

They require strict time and temperature control – that is, they need to be kept in a fridge, have a short shelf life and have a ‘use-by’ date. 

High-risk foods provide the ideal conditions for bacterial multiplication to levels that cause food poisoning when the food spends enough time in warm conditions. Being ready to eat, high-risk foods do not require any further preparation (for example, cooking), which might destroy pathogenic micro-organisms, before being eaten.

### Cross-contamination
You have already learned that a contaminant is something that gets into or onto food and should not be there. Contamination is the process by which this happens.

Cross-contamination is a particular form of contamination and occurs when bacteria are transferred from a contaminated source, such as raw meat or food waste, to a high-risk food.
 
It was cross-contamination that caused the guests who ate the ham sandwiches to develop food poisoning. Mary transferred pathogenic micro-organisms from the contaminated source (raw chicken) to a high-risk food (the ham sandwiches).

### Vehicles of contamination

Cross-contamination usually involves a vehicle of contamination – something that helps the bacteria to ‘travel’ from one surface to another. Here are some common vehicles of contamination. All of these have something in common – they are hand-contact and/or food-contact surfaces.

**Hands**

Food handlers can transfer bacteria from one surface to another. For example, as Mary did when she failed to wash her hands after touching the raw chicken and preparing the ham sandwiches. 

Food handlers can also transfer bacteria and viruses from themselves to food. For example, Staphylococcus aureus on the skin or in the nose and throat. For this reason, food handlers need to take care not to transfer bacteria on their hands from: cuts or infections on their skin their mouths – for example, when eating or tasting food, or coughing and sneezing.  

**Cloths**

It is known that one of the greatest sources of bacteria in a kitchen is cleaning cloths. This is because they are often used to clean dirty surfaces and are then not disinfected adequately. As a result, they hold bacteria and as they are used around a kitchen, deposit huge numbers of bacteria wherever they touch.

**Utensils and equipment**

Utensils and equipment – such as knives and chopping boards – or any surface that has not been cleaned properly between uses can cause cross-contamination.

**Handles**

The handles of doors, fridges, cupboards etc., which are touched in the course of food preparation, are common vehicles of cross-contamination.

Cross-contamination can have a serious impact on a person’s health. It takes only a small lapse in hygiene standards for a food to become contaminated. Take a look at these instances of cross-contamination in the process of making a chicken caesar salad.

**Unsafe food storage**

Raw and ready-to-eat foods should be separated.

If they are kept in a single storage unit, **raw food** should be placed at the **bottom** and **ready-to-eat** at the **top**. All food must be covered.

**Hands not washed regularly**

Hands are a common cause of cross-contamination. After handling any raw food, you must wash your hands thoroughly. 

You should also ensure they are washed regularly throughout the day and also after handling any waste.

**Unclean utensils**

Separate utensils and equipment must be used for raw foods and should be cleaned thoroughly between tasks.

### Store with care

As you have just seen, the risk of cross-contamination can be controlled by considering the sources and vehicles of contamination.

Raw food should always be stored separately from ready-to-eat food. Ideally, there should be separate fridges for these two types of food. Where this is not possible, store raw food on the lower shelves of the refrigerator and the ready-to-eat food on the shelves above.

### Keep your hands clean

Always wash your hands after handling raw food and before handling ready-to-eat food.

If possible, different people should prepare raw and ready-to-eat food.

Handle ready-to-eat food as little as possible and use clean equipment such as tongs rather than hands.

Always cover food in storage.

### Clean and separate

Always use clean utensils when preparing food.

Make sure that all utensils are cleaned thoroughly between uses.

If possible, use colour-coded utensils, such as knives and chopping boards. These should be used in a system to maintain a strict separation between those that are used for contaminated raw foods and those that are used for high-risk foods. It is **common**, for example, to have **red boards and knives for raw meat** and **green for ready-to-eat foods**.

### Fresh and clean every time

Cleaning cloths must be thoroughly cleaned and disinfected regularly. 

The use of colour-coded cleaning cloths and equipment is one way to reduce risk. A particular colour is used for a particular area – for example, red for raw meat areas and green for ready-to-eat areas.

One of the **best ways** to prevent cross-contamination from cloths is to use **single-use, disposable cloths and paper towels** that are thrown away immediately after use.
