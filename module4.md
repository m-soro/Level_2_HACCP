### Before you check temperatures
If it is your job to check temperatures, you must be trained in how to:	
* check the temperature
* record the temperature.

You must also be instructed about:	
* which temperatures are unsafe
* what to do if a reading is unsafe.

### Temperature measuring devices
There are a number of devices used to measure the temperature of food.

* A hand-held, hard probe thermometer.
* An infra-red probe, gun type.
* Integrated equipment, for example, a thermometer with an in-built recording device.

### Calibration and cleaning
If you use a hand-held, hard probe thermometer, you should ensure that it is:
* Calibrated
* Cleaned and disinfected.

**Calibration**

Calibration is the process of checking and adjusting equipment so that it measures accurately.

Every device must be calibrated according to the manufacturer’s instructions:

* before it is used for the first time
* at regular intervals (and at least once every three months), as a matter of course
* if it has been damaged or it is felt that it is giving inaccurate readings
* according to your supervisor’s instructions.

**Cleaning**

A probe must be washed in hot water and detergent after every use.

**Disinfection** 

The washed device should then be disinfected, for example with anti-bacterial wipes, before being used again.

### Taking temperatures
Taking temperatures the right way is vital if the records are to be of value.

Wherever possible, take the temperature of food, rather than the air temperature in a fridge. Air temperature can change very quickly, for instance if the door is opened, whereas food takes longer to absorb the ambient temperature.

The equipment being used to take the temperature and its location within a fridge will affect the reading.  

### Good practice
To measure the temperature of food in a fridge, ideally use a product substitute.

A product substitute is anything used for taking temperatures only. You could use an apple or packet of butter.
Once the product is probed it should be labelled ‘for temperature checks only’
The **product substitute** should be placed in the fridge in the **warmest position (usually the top shelf as warm air rises)**.

The product substitute will react to the increases and decreases of temperature just like the food in the fridge.

### Other methods

Depending on the measuring device being used, alternative ways to take refrigeration temperatures include:
* placing the probe end within the fridge and leaving it for as long as is necessary for the temperature display to settle – this may take a minute or more
* inserting a ‘between pack’ probe between packs of food, making sure that it is in close contact with the outer packaging of the products.

### Using integrated equipment

Using integrated equipment to take and record refrigeration temperatures could give an incorrect reading. 

1. The thermometer is reading the air temperature in the fridge, not the temperature of the food within the fridge.
2. The thermometer is reading the air temperature only in one part of the fridge, so you do not really know the temperature in the other parts.
3. The thermometer is located very close to where the coldest air comes out of the chilling unit, so it might be reading a very low temperature when the air elsewhere in the fridge is warmer.
4. The integrated equipment may not be calibrated properly.

### The right temperature
It is recommended that **frozen** foods should be stored at **-18°C** to stop bacteria getting the warmth and moisture they need to multiply.

It is also recommended that **chilled** food should be stored at or below **5°C**. The **law**, however, allows chilled food to be kept at or below **8°C**.

It is known that at least two common pathogenic bacteria can multiply slowly at lower temperatures, these are **Listeria** and **Yersinia**. It is, therefore, important to keep refrigeration temperatures as cold as possible. You will remember that the **danger zone** for most bacterial multiplication is **between 5°C and 63°C**.

### Importance of rapid cooling
Take a minute to think about why cooked food must be cooled down rapidly before it is put in a fridge.
 
Incorrect cooling of hot food is a major cause of food poisoning.
* Ideally you should aim to **cool food to 5°C or less** within **one to two hours after cooking**. This is to ensure it is in the danger zone for the shortest period of time
* Putting hot food in the fridge will raise the temperature inside the fridge.

### Safe rapid cooling

Let’s take a look at how this chef safely cools the chilli he has just cooked for tomorrow's lunchtime service.

The chef begins by filling a shallow tray with ice.

Next, he divides the food into smaller portions and places them onto the shallow tray, on top of the ice.

Once the chilli has been divided up, he leaves it to cool. He waits until the chilli reaches 10°C.

Once the chilli has reached 10°C, he places it in the fridge. The temperature will now gradually and safely decrease.

### Methods of cooling food
The best way to cool hot food quickly is by using a blast chiller, but if you do not have one use alternative safe methods:
*  Divide the food into smaller portions – for example, cutting a chicken into quarters – this will assist cooling as the heat can leave more easily.
* Put liquid food such as stocks, sauces, stews or soups into cold, shallow trays – this will increase the surface area to allow faster steam let-off and thus cooling.
* Put the food in a container in a bain marie with iced water – the food will, in effect, cool in a cold water bath.
* Stir the food to speed up the cooling process.
* Make a concentrate product and add ice to it.

When chilling food, always make sure that it is covered to protect it from contamination.

### Why freeze food?

Food should be frozen in its freshest state – not long after it has been bought or prepared and whilst it is still in good condition. If you freeze fresh food you can preserve it for a long time. Freezing stops bacteria from multiplying and spoiling the food. At **-18°C and colder**, water is tightly bound in ice crystals so bacteria cannot use the moisture. Remember, however, that **bacteria are not killed by freezing** – they simply become dormant. You should freeze food that is to be kept for some time as quickly as possible.

You must not put warm food into the freezer:
the temperature of the freezer will rise and cause other food to defrost and bacteria could start multiplying
ice may build up in the freezer, meaning you need to clean and defrost the freezer and that the unit needs to work harder, leading to a rise in power consumption and cost.

### Defrosting food
Before leaving work one evening, Colin leaves a large frozen turkey on a counter to defrost overnight.

In the morning, Sam finds the outer flesh of the turkey soft and presumes that it is defrosted. Having heated the oven, she roasts the turkey. Taking it out for service, Sam begins carving and she notices that the juices are pink, but continues to serve the turkey to customers.

What do you think went wrong in the defrosting procedure?

### What went wrong?
Quite a few things went wrong. These are:

* Colin should have defrosted the turkey in a fridge over a sufficiently long period of time
* Sam should have checked that the turkey was thoroughly defrosted before cooking
* Sam should have ensured that the turkey was thoroughly cooked before serving
* Sam should have not served it having realised it was not properly cooked.
Remember, poultry is linked to pathogenic bacteria such as Campylobacter. At present, this is the most common bacterial cause of food poisoning in the UK.

### How to defrost food
Some foods – for example, patisserie items like croissants – are safe to cook from frozen if you follow the manufacturer’s instructions. However, most raw foods, particularly meat and poultry, need thorough defrosting before cooking. You should not defrost food at room temperature, because the surface of the food will then quickly enter the danger zone. Depending upon the type and size of the food and the manufacturer’s instructions, food should be defrosted in one of the following ways:
* using a fridge at a temperature of up to 5°C
* using a specialist defrosting unit
* using a microwave, and following the manufacturer’s instructions (you must check food is defrosted throughout)
* by putting under cold, clean water when defrosting small frozen food items such as prawns (you should take steps to prevent cross-contamination).

1. Keep food covered - When using a fridge for defrosting, keep the food covered.
2. Select appropriate container - Remember that liquid can build up as the ice in the food defrosts, so select an appropriate container and put this in the correct part of the fridge, to avoid cross-contamination.
3. Allow plenty of time - When defrosting large items such as chickens or joints of meat, always plan ahead and allow plenty of time – a large joint might need 24 hours or more to fully defrost at **5ºC**.
4. Use clean containers - The container used for defrosting should be clean and used only for this purpose.
5. Never re-freeze food - Never re-freeze food that has been defrosted. If the food passes through the danger zone, bacteria can multiply and the risk of food poisoning increases. Defrosting and re-freezing also affect quality and nutrient content.

### Safe cooking temperatures and re-heating food

### Cook thoroughly
Bacteria and other micro-organisms are an essential part of the natural world, and many foods and ingredients are already contaminated when they are delivered to food businesses. 
 
1. **High temperatures destroy bacteria**
High temperatures outside the danger zone can be used to destroy pathogenic micro-organisms in food.

It is important that food is cooked thoroughly and the target temperature is achieved throughout. Undercooking, in other words not reaching the right temperature, will enable bacteria to survive.

Food is usually cooked in an oven, on a hob or in a microwave.

2. **Oven or Hob**

When using an oven or a hob – stirring and turning food will help to ensure that heat penetrates all parts so that the food is thoroughly cooked and safe.

3. **Microwave**

In a microwave, the temperature is not evenly distributed, so ‘pockets’ of food may not be as thoroughly heated as the rest.

To avoid an uneven temperature distribution, stirring liquid or semi-liquid foods once or twice during heating is helpful. Where food cannot be stirred, for instance when heating a pie, the food should be left for two minutes after cooking to allow the temperature to equalise.

### Reheating – the golden rules
1. Make sure that the food is **reheated to a temperature of at least 75°C**.
2. Check that all parts of the food are reheated thoroughly.
3. Reheat quickly to restrict the time the food stays in the danger zone.
4. Only reheat food once (any leftovers must be thrown away).

### Reheating and the danger zone
It is better to cook food and serve straightaway rather than to cool hot food and store it to be reheated later. Food that is cooked, cooled and stored before reheating goes through the danger zone a number of times, giving the bacteria more chance to multiply and to produce toxins. This can make food unsafe to eat.

### Dangers of reheating
Food that has not been reheated to a high enough temperature for a long enough time is a common cause of food poisoning. Any bacteria present, for example from contamination after cooking or storage, need to be killed. Inadequate reheating will enable bacteria to survive and multiply within the danger zone. Any bacterial spores in the food could also germinate, potentially adding even more bacteria to the food. 

If reheating happens too slowly, the food will be in the danger zone for too long and any bacteria present will have the opportunity to multiply. They will only be **destroyed when the temperature reaches 75ºC**.

Another reason why reheating food is **discouraged** is because **heat does not destroy bacterial toxins**. If food has been cooked, cooled, stored and reheated there may be toxins present from the action of toxin-producing bacteria multiplying. Heat does not generally destroy these toxins.

### Hot holding
Hot holding is the practice of keeping food hot after it has been cooked or reheated. You can see it in many situations such as self-service canteens. In kitchens, hot holding is common, too, for instance to keep stocks and sauces warm during service.

**The law**

It is a legal requirement that food being **held hot** must be held **at or above 63ºC**. Food will have been heated to above this temperature **(70 ºC for 2 minutes to cook or 75 ºC to reheat)** and will remain **safe if maintained** at **or above 63 ºC**.
 
The law states that **if the temperature of food drops below 63ºC**, it must be **sold**, **served** or **refrigerated within two hours** or **thrown away**. This is particularly important to remember when food is being kept in a hot display unit.

Hot holding in practice

* In practice it is important to check the temperature of hot-held food regularly
* The temperature should be taken in several places within the food as it may cool on the unheated surface and remain hot near the heating element
* Always act on the coolest temperature recorded.

### Why is there a time limit on hot holding below 63ºC?

**In case the food is contaminated after cooking and bacteria survive and multiply?**
* The time limit helps to restrict the opportunity for bacterial multiplication should food become contaminated after cooking, for example by contact with dirty equipment, dirty hands or even from airborne contamination such as staff coughing or sneezing on the food.

**In case any spores that survive cooking germinate and the resulting bacteria start to multiply?**
* Spores do survive the heat of cooking and, once food is in the danger zone, they can turn back into bacteria and multiply to dangerous levels. So the less time the food remains in the danger zone the less opportunity there will be for bacterial multiplication.

**In case a physical contaminant gets onto the food?**
* The amount of time a food is kept warm is not an issue if a physical contaminant is introduced, such as a piece of glass. The glass will be there after five minutes or five hours.

### Critical control points
The most important point is **never to assume that food is cooked, you must actively check it**. Cooking is nearly always a ‘critical control point’ in food safety; if food is not cooked thoroughly, it may not be safe to eat.

It is good practice to confirm that the cooking equipment you are using is working efficiently (this is particularly important for grills, griddles and fryers) This can be done by checking the core temperature of a sample from a batch. A reading from a calibrated probe thermometer is better than relying on the temperature dial or display of the equipment. 

Recording the temperatures will help the business to demonstrate that the critical control points are being monitored. If when recording the temperature of cooked and hot-held food you find that it is not the right temperature, you should report this to your supervisor so that appropriate corrective action can be taken.
