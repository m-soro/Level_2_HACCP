### Before you check temperatures
If it is your job to check temperatures, you must be trained in how to:	
* check the temperature
* record the temperature.

You must also be instructed about:	
* which temperatures are unsafe
* what to do if a reading is unsafe.

### Temperature measuring devices
There are a number of devices used to measure the temperature of food.

* A hand-held, hard probe thermometer.
* An infra-red probe, gun type.
* Integrated equipment, for example, a thermometer with an in-built recording device.

### Calibration and cleaning
If you use a hand-held, hard probe thermometer, you should ensure that it is:
* Calibrated
* Cleaned and disinfected.

**Calibration**

Calibration is the process of checking and adjusting equipment so that it measures accurately.

Every device must be calibrated according to the manufacturer’s instructions:

* before it is used for the first time
* at regular intervals (and at least once every three months), as a matter of course
* if it has been damaged or it is felt that it is giving inaccurate readings
* according to your supervisor’s instructions.

**Cleaning**

A probe must be washed in hot water and detergent after every use.

**Disinfection** 

The washed device should then be disinfected, for example with anti-bacterial wipes, before being used again.

### Taking temperatures
Taking temperatures the right way is vital if the records are to be of value.

Wherever possible, take the temperature of food, rather than the air temperature in a fridge. Air temperature can change very quickly, for instance if the door is opened, whereas food takes longer to absorb the ambient temperature.

The equipment being used to take the temperature and its location within a fridge will affect the reading.  

### Good practice
To measure the temperature of food in a fridge, ideally use a product substitute.

A product substitute is anything used for taking temperatures only. You could use an apple or packet of butter.
Once the product is probed it should be labelled ‘for temperature checks only’
The **product substitute** should be placed in the fridge in the **warmest position (usually the top shelf as warm air rises)**.

The product substitute will react to the increases and decreases of temperature just like the food in the fridge.

### Other methods

Depending on the measuring device being used, alternative ways to take refrigeration temperatures include:
* placing the probe end within the fridge and leaving it for as long as is necessary for the temperature display to settle – this may take a minute or more
* inserting a ‘between pack’ probe between packs of food, making sure that it is in close contact with the outer packaging of the products.

### Using integrated equipment

Using integrated equipment to take and record refrigeration temperatures could give an incorrect reading. 

1. The thermometer is reading the air temperature in the fridge, not the temperature of the food within the fridge.
2. The thermometer is reading the air temperature only in one part of the fridge, so you do not really know the temperature in the other parts.
3. The thermometer is located very close to where the coldest air comes out of the chilling unit, so it might be reading a very low temperature when the air elsewhere in the fridge is warmer.
4. The integrated equipment may not be calibrated properly.

### The right temperature
It is recommended that **frozen** foods should be stored at **-18°C** to stop bacteria getting the warmth and moisture they need to multiply.

It is also recommended that **chilled** food should be stored at or below **5°C**. The **law**, however, allows chilled food to be kept at or below **8°C**.

It is known that at least two common pathogenic bacteria can multiply slowly at lower temperatures, these are **Listeria** and **Yersinia**. It is, therefore, important to keep refrigeration temperatures as cold as possible. You will remember that the **danger zone** for most bacterial multiplication is **between 5°C and 63°C**.

### Importance of rapid cooling
Take a minute to think about why cooked food must be cooled down rapidly before it is put in a fridge.
 
Incorrect cooling of hot food is a major cause of food poisoning.
* Ideally you should aim to **cool food to 5°C or less** within **one to two hours after cooking**. This is to ensure it is in the danger zone for the shortest period of time
* Putting hot food in the fridge will raise the temperature inside the fridge.

### Safe rapid cooling
Let’s take a look at how this chef safely cools the chilli he has just cooked for tomorrow's lunchtime service.

The chef begins by filling a shallow tray with ice.

Next, he divides the food into smaller portions and places them onto the shallow tray, on top of the ice.

Once the chilli has been divided up, he leaves it to cool. He waits until the chilli reaches 10°C.

Once the chilli has reached 10°C, he places it in the fridge. The temperature will now gradually and safely decrease.
