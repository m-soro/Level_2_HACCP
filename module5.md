### Personal hygiene

* **Hands** -  Food handlers must wash their hands regularly throughout the working day to reduce the number of bacteria on their skin and prevent contamination and cross-contamination. We will look at hand washing in more detail in the next section. 
* **Fingernails** - Fingernails should always be short, clean and unvarnished, as nail varnish prevents proper cleaning, harbours dirt and bacteria and may chip and contaminate food. For the same reason, food handlers must not have nail extensions.
* **Skin complaints** - Cuts, boils, sores and other skin problems and infections can all harbour pathogenic bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus, that can cause food poisoning. Food handlers with minor cuts and sores can usually continue to work providing that the cut or sore can be covered with a brightly-coloured waterproof plaster.
* **Mouth, nose and throat** - The mouth, nose and throat can all harbour pathogenic bacteria, particularly Staphylococcus aureus. When food handlers sneeze, cough or touch their nose or mouth they can transfer bacteria to food, utensils and preparation surfaces. Food handlers with coughs and colds may not be allowed to prepare food, and should always wash their hands after touching their nose or mouth.
* **Hair** - Staphylococcus aureus and other pathogenic bacteria may be found in hair. To protect food from contamination, food handlers should keep hair tied back and, preferably, completely covered (for example, with a hair net or hat) while working in the food area. Food handlers should never be allowed to comb their hair when in a food area or when they are wearing protective clothing.
* **Toiletries** - Strongly scented soap, perfume, aftershave and deodorants may taint food and, therefore, should not be used by food handlers.
* **Jewellery** - Food handlers should not wear any jewellery because it can harbour dirt and bacteria and could cause physical contamination if bits of it fall into food. If, for any reason, jewellery cannot be removed, it should be covered with a brightly-coloured, waterproof plaster.
* **Clothing** - Everyone working in a food handling area must wear clean protective clothing to protect food from contamination. Later in this module we will look at the types of protective clothing food handlers commonly wear. Protective clothing should cover the food handler’s own clothes.

### Reporting illness
You must tell your employer if you have had, or are currently suffering from food poisoning or any illness with similar symptoms.

This is because you must not work with food if you have certain illnesses or symptoms – because you could contaminate food. You may need medical attention or you may need a doctor’s approval before you can restart work with food.
You must tell your employer if you have any of the following symptoms: Diarrhoea, vomiting, nausea, ear, eye and nose discharges, a cut, wound or other skin condition that leaves broken skin, or a skin infection.

You must also report symptoms of food poisoning among members of your family or close personal friends. This is because you could be a carrier – someone who carries bacteria or viruses without having any symptoms of the illnesses they cause.

### Unhygienic habits
Some habits can appear harmless until you remember how easily pathogenic micro-organisms are spread. You must never:
* handle food without washing your hands first
* forget to wash your hands after going to the toilet or handling waste
* dry your hands on your clothing or cleaning cloths
* pick or wipe your nose on your sleeve
* cough or sneeze over food
* spit
* blow or breathe on glassware and cutlery
* use your fingers to test food, or a spoon that hasn’t been washed first
* lick your finger (to make it easier to pick up something or separate materials like food wrap)
* eat or smoke in food areas.

### Keeping your hands clean
Hand washing is one of the most important actions you can take to help prevent contamination and avoid causing food poisoning.

As a food handler, when should you wash your hands?
 
1. Before:
* starting work 
* handling high-risk food. 
2. After:
* Always wash your hands after:
* visiting the toilet
* handling raw food
* handling raw eggs
* coughing or sneezing
* touching your hair or face
* handling cleaning chemicals
* handling waste
* eating, drinking or smoking.
3. Periodically:
* as often as necessary to keep hands clean
* throughout your shift, and particularly between each task.

### The correct steps for washing your hands are as follows:
* use the correct basin
* use hot water and soap (it is preferable to use antibacterial, liquid soap as bars of soap can harbour bacteria and are, therefore, unhygienic)
* work the soap into your hands, rubbing them together for 15–20 seconds
* clean the back of your hands, between your fingers and your wrists
* clean your nails with a nail brush
* rinse your hands before drying them
* never dry hands on tea towels or service cloths as this could instantly re-contaminate your hands or anything else the cloth touches.

In some workplaces, food handlers are encouraged to rub an alcohol-based sanitizing gel into their hands after washing and drying to destroy any remaining bacteria. There is no need to rinse off the alcohol rub as it evaporates and does not leave a residue. This is, however, no substitute for good hand washing.

### Protective clothing
Protective clothing may include items such as overalls, aprons, chefs’ jackets, trousers, hats and hairnets, shoes and gloves. As well as protecting food from contamination, protective clothing can also help to protect food handlers from harm – for example, non-slip shoes to prevent slips and trips or rubber gloves for use with cleaning chemicals.

* **Hats and hairnets** - Hats and hairnets stop hands touching hair and ears and stop hair from falling into food. 
* **Shoes** - Dedicated shoes or overshoes can stop any contamination from the soles of outdoor shoes from entering food preparation areas.
* **Gloves** - Sometimes food handlers use gloves to handle ready-to-eat food, but if hands are kept clean there should be no need to wear gloves when preparing food.

### A note on overalls
Overalls, aprons, chefs’ jackets and trousers should cover the food handlers’ own clothes and be:

* clean
* washable or disposable
* light coloured
* without buttons or external pockets.

**Washable or disposable**
 
Protective clothing should be changed and washed at regular intervals at the right temperature to ensure that the clothing is properly cleaned before re-use. Some protective clothing is disposable – that is, used once only before being thrown away. 

Dirty clothing can cause biological and physical contamination.

**Light coloured**
 
To show up the dirt and remind staff to change the clothing before it gets too contaminated.

**Without buttons or external pockets**
 
To prevent physical contamination – buttons can fall off if not securely fastened and pockets encourage food handlers to carry objects, such as pencils, paperclips or string, into food areas where they could fall into food

### Methods of preservation
After time all foods will decompose due to the action of spoilage micro-organisms. The shelf life of food can be extended by preservation. There are a number of different methods of preservation, but they are all based on the same principle – **to remove one or more of the requirements for bacterial multiplication (food, moisture, warmth and time)**.

* Drying - removes moisture
* Freezing - removes warmth and moisture. At and below -18C water is tightly bound that it is unavaibale for bacterial multiplication.
* Chilling - removes warmth.
* Pickling and Preserving - Pickling(Alcohol, vinegar), Preserving(sugar) removes moisture by 'locking it' away chemically.
* Vaccuum or Modified Athmosphere Packaging(MAP) - removes the oxygen for bacterial growth. MAP removes oxygen by replacing it with other gasses that prevents bacterial growth.
* UHT or canning - Ultra heat treament or canning kills pathogenic and spoilage micro organisms.
* Smoking - removes moisture and the chemicals in smoke kills micro organisms. 

## Preservation of food and date-marking

Storing preserved food

Even though a food may have been preserved by one of the methods you have just seen, this may not be enough to prevent spoilage. Without the correct storage conditions, even preserved food can go off.


Things to be careful of

Be careful of the following:

1. If a high-risk food is vacuum packed, always store it in a fridge. (People often think that vacuum-packed foods can be kept at ambient or room temperature, but most cannot. This is because despite oxygen being removed or substituted, some micro-organisms can still multiply and spoil the food)

2. Once preserved food has been opened, if it is a high-risk food, it will need stored in a refrigerator. (For instance, salami may have a six-month shelf life at ambient temperatures because it has a high level of acid and low level of moisture. Once it is cut, however, it will need storing in the fridge and using up quickly: The six-month shelf life no longer applies)

3. Keep dry food in airtight containers, away from moisture. (UHT, canned and pickled foods can be kept in a dry store)

4. Always check the storage instructions on the food label.

## Best-before date

Best-before dates usually appear on food that has a longer shelf-life, particularly when it is stored as recommended. It is not an automatic offence to sell food past its best-before dates, but its quality and safety may be compromised.

Best-before dates are normally found on:
* canned food, which is bacteria-free
* dried food, in which bacteria cannot easily multiply
* frozen food, which can be stored for several months in a freezer without spoiling.

## Use-by dates

All pre-packed food should display one of two date marks. These are either the:
* ‘use-by’ date, or
* ‘best-before’ date.

Use-by dates are found on high-risk food likely to cause food poisoning including those that:
* are ready to eat
* are moist
* are high in protein
* require chilling
* have a short shelf life.

Once such food has passed its use-by date, it has exceeded the critical time limit within which it is considered safe. The number of bacteria might be enough to cause food poisoning, and that is why it is a criminal offence for a food business to sell any food past its use-by date.

### What to do with food pat its date mark?

**Dispose of it immediately**

If an enforcement officer finds food past its use-by date at a food business, he will assume that it is for sale. This is against the law, and the business operator could be prosecuted. The only exception might be if the food is being held separately and is clearly marked ‘Not for human consumption’.

Any food that has not been consumed by its use-by date must be disposed of immediately.


 **Use with discretion**

It is not against the law to sell products past their best-before dates. However, any such food must be carefully checked before being used, as both its quality and safety will be compromised. For instance, biscuits can go soft.

## Safe food handling and storage conditions

**Check the temperature**

Check the temperature of chilled and frozen food on delivery to make sure it is within the limits set in the food safety management procedures. If it is not, you will probably need to reject the delivery and report it to your supervisor.


**Put fresh food in the fridge quickly**
When handling food or ingredients that would normally be refrigerated, always ensure that they are put back into the fridge as quickly as possible after preparation.

## Chilled and frozen foods safe storage

1. Clean
* Clean the fridge (including its seals) regularly to avoid the build up of dirt and ensure efficiency. Defrost and clean the freezer regularly, to avoid ice build up and ensure efficient running.

2. Prepare for storage
* put food in food-safe containers
* cover or wrap the food
* label and date the food.

3. Store properly
* if raw and ready-to-eat foods are to be stored in the same unit, ensure that the raw food is put on the shelves below the ready-to-eat food (ideally, the foods should be stored in separate fridges or freezers)
* put the items with the longest shelf-life behind or below those with the shortest shelf-life and use the items in date order
* keep the food in the suppliers’ packaging and, once opened, reseal with care
* if you have to re-wrap food, label it clearly noting the supplier, batch code, best before date, etc.
* never put warm food in a fridge or freezer
* don’t overstock
* if stacking a walk-in unit, ensure that air can circulate and that the fan is not obstructed with stored product
* stack tidily and immediately clean up any food spills.

## Spotting storage hazards
* Dirty vegetables in fridge - Clean the fridge regularly and defrost the freezer as necessary.
* Food in opened tins - Put food in food-safe containers.
* Uncovered/unwrapped food - Cover or properly wrap all food.
* Unlabelled/undated food - label and date food. 
* Contents in a mess - keep contents neat and tidy.
* Overstocked - do not overstock fridge.
* No order - use food in date order.
* Warm food in fridge - do not put warm food in fridge.
* Raw and ready to eat foods are randomly placed - make sure raw food id below the ready to eat food.

## Dry goods safe storage

Dry goods such as cereals, biscuits, flour and sugar, can also spoil if they are not stored in cool, dry conditions. Again, there are some simple rules to follow:

* proper ventilation allows air to circulate and helps stop moulds and fungi from building up
* proper lighting allows you to check for cleanliness, signs of pest infestation and date marks
* dried goods should be kept off the floor and away from walls, ideally on shelving. This makes it much easier to clean underneath and around the goods, and provides access for pest control.

Again, dried goods should be stored tidily and in date order.

## Food allergy and intolerance

A food that is perfectly safe for one person to eat may be extremely hazardous for another.
 
**Food allergy**: Food allergy occurs when an individual’s immune system reacts to a food or a food additive. Food allergy affects a small number of adults and children. True allergic reactions are often mild but can be life threatening.
 
**Food intolerance**: Food intolerance is different in that it does not affect the immune system and is not life threatening, (though long-term health can be affected). Nonetheless, the symptoms can be severe and include diarrhoea, bloating and anaemia.

There are many foods that can cause an allergic reaction, those listed above, however, are responsible for 90% of allergic reactions within the UK.

* Celery - including stalks, leaves, seeds and celeriac is commonly found in soups, salads, celery salt, some meat products. 
* Cereals containing gluten - Gluten is found in wheat and some other cereals such as rye and barley. It is used in flour and thus bread, pasta, cakes, pastry, meat products, sauces, soups, batter, stock cubes, breadcrumbs and food dusted with flour.
* Crustaceans - including prawns, crabs and lobsters, can also be found in other food for example - shrimp paste.
* Eggs - many people are allergic to egg ang egg products. It is an ingredient in many cakes, mouses, sauces, pasta, quiche, some meat products, mayonnaise and foods brushed with egg wash.
* Fish - Can also be found in pizza, salad dressings, relishes, fish and soy sauce and worcester sauce. 
* Lupin - lupin flour is commonly found in bread, pastries, pies and batter for example - onion rings.
* Milk - is a common cause of allergies. A person that is allergic to milk is also likely be allergic to products made from it including cream, cheese, butter, yoghurt and products such as pies glazed with milk.

## Food allergy symptoms
Food allergy symptoms are varied and range from being mild to potentially fatal.

**Severe (anaphylactic)** reactions can cause the blood pressure and heart rate to become dangerously low. Without treatment, an affected individual can die within minutes.

## Is there an allergen in the food?

People with allergies need to know that the food they eat is free from even the tiniest amount of the allergens to which they are sensitive. Although a food may not contain a particular ingredient it may still cause an allergic reaction if it has been contaminated by the ingredient at some point in the process of preparation. 
 
It is very important that people who handle, prepare or serve food understand how to control the risks posed by food allergies.

* You must take care to ensure that you give the right information about ingredients to customers who ask. Never guess – if you don’t know, check with your supervisor
* It is an offence to sell unsafe food, this includes giving wrong information regarding the presence of an allergen in food, by a misleading or incorrect label, on the menu or verbally.

## Preventing allergen contamination
As a food handler, you must be very careful not to accidentally contaminate food that is supposed to be free from allergens.

One way to prevent this is to follow the same rules for preventing contamination that we covered earlier.

You should:

* carefully and thoroughly wash all equipment and your hands at the start and end of preparation
* prepare allergen-free food in a separate area, and use equipment only for this purpose. Where separation isn’t possible, you should carefully and thoroughly clean the area, all equipment and your hands before preparing the food.
