### Personal hygiene

* **Hands** -  Food handlers must wash their hands regularly throughout the working day to reduce the number of bacteria on their skin and prevent contamination and cross-contamination. We will look at hand washing in more detail in the next section. 
* **Fingernails** - Fingernails should always be short, clean and unvarnished, as nail varnish prevents proper cleaning, harbours dirt and bacteria and may chip and contaminate food. For the same reason, food handlers must not have nail extensions.
* **Skin complaints** - Cuts, boils, sores and other skin problems and infections can all harbour pathogenic bacteria, such as Staphylococcus aureus, that can cause food poisoning. Food handlers with minor cuts and sores can usually continue to work providing that the cut or sore can be covered with a brightly-coloured waterproof plaster.
* **Mouth, nose and throat** - The mouth, nose and throat can all harbour pathogenic bacteria, particularly Staphylococcus aureus. When food handlers sneeze, cough or touch their nose or mouth they can transfer bacteria to food, utensils and preparation surfaces. Food handlers with coughs and colds may not be allowed to prepare food, and should always wash their hands after touching their nose or mouth.
* **Hair** - Staphylococcus aureus and other pathogenic bacteria may be found in hair. To protect food from contamination, food handlers should keep hair tied back and, preferably, completely covered (for example, with a hair net or hat) while working in the food area. Food handlers should never be allowed to comb their hair when in a food area or when they are wearing protective clothing.
* **Toiletries** - Strongly scented soap, perfume, aftershave and deodorants may taint food and, therefore, should not be used by food handlers.
* **Jewellery** - Food handlers should not wear any jewellery because it can harbour dirt and bacteria and could cause physical contamination if bits of it fall into food. If, for any reason, jewellery cannot be removed, it should be covered with a brightly-coloured, waterproof plaster.
* **Clothing** - Everyone working in a food handling area must wear clean protective clothing to protect food from contamination. Later in this module we will look at the types of protective clothing food handlers commonly wear. Protective clothing should cover the food handler’s own clothes.

### Reporting illness
You must tell your employer if you have had, or are currently suffering from food poisoning or any illness with similar symptoms.

This is because you must not work with food if you have certain illnesses or symptoms – because you could contaminate food. You may need medical attention or you may need a doctor’s approval before you can restart work with food.
You must tell your employer if you have any of the following symptoms: Diarrhoea, vomiting, nausea, ear, eye and nose discharges, a cut, wound or other skin condition that leaves broken skin, or a skin infection.

You must also report symptoms of food poisoning among members of your family or close personal friends. This is because you could be a carrier – someone who carries bacteria or viruses without having any symptoms of the illnesses they cause.

### Unhygienic habits
Some habits can appear harmless until you remember how easily pathogenic micro-organisms are spread. You must never:
* handle food without washing your hands first
* forget to wash your hands after going to the toilet or handling waste
* dry your hands on your clothing or cleaning cloths
* pick or wipe your nose on your sleeve
* cough or sneeze over food
* spit
* blow or breathe on glassware and cutlery
* use your fingers to test food, or a spoon that hasn’t been washed first
* lick your finger (to make it easier to pick up something or separate materials like food wrap)
* eat or smoke in food areas.

### Keeping your hands clean
Hand washing is one of the most important actions you can take to help prevent contamination and avoid causing food poisoning.

As a food handler, when should you wash your hands?
 
1. Before:
* starting work 
* handling high-risk food. 
2. After:
* Always wash your hands after:
* visiting the toilet
* handling raw food
* handling raw eggs
* coughing or sneezing
* touching your hair or face
* handling cleaning chemicals
* handling waste
* eating, drinking or smoking.
3. Periodically:
* as often as necessary to keep hands clean
* throughout your shift, and particularly between each task.

### The correct steps for washing your hands are as follows:
* use the correct basin
* use hot water and soap (it is preferable to use antibacterial, liquid soap as bars of soap can harbour bacteria and are, therefore, unhygienic)
* work the soap into your hands, rubbing them together for 15–20 seconds
* clean the back of your hands, between your fingers and your wrists
* clean your nails with a nail brush
* rinse your hands before drying them
* never dry hands on tea towels or service cloths as this could instantly re-contaminate your hands or anything else the cloth touches.

In some workplaces, food handlers are encouraged to rub an alcohol-based sanitizing gel into their hands after washing and drying to destroy any remaining bacteria. There is no need to rinse off the alcohol rub as it evaporates and does not leave a residue. This is, however, no substitute for good hand washing.

### Protective clothing
Protective clothing may include items such as overalls, aprons, chefs’ jackets, trousers, hats and hairnets, shoes and gloves. As well as protecting food from contamination, protective clothing can also help to protect food handlers from harm – for example, non-slip shoes to prevent slips and trips or rubber gloves for use with cleaning chemicals.

* **Hats and hairnets** - Hats and hairnets stop hands touching hair and ears and stop hair from falling into food. 
* **Shoes** - Dedicated shoes or overshoes can stop any contamination from the soles of outdoor shoes from entering food preparation areas.
* **Gloves** - Sometimes food handlers use gloves to handle ready-to-eat food, but if hands are kept clean there should be no need to wear gloves when preparing food.

### A note on overalls
Overalls, aprons, chefs’ jackets and trousers should cover the food handlers’ own clothes and be:

* clean
* washable or disposable
* light coloured
* without buttons or external pockets.

**Washable or disposable**
 
Protective clothing should be changed and washed at regular intervals at the right temperature to ensure that the clothing is properly cleaned before re-use. Some protective clothing is disposable – that is, used once only before being thrown away. 

Dirty clothing can cause biological and physical contamination.

**Light coloured**
 
To show up the dirt and remind staff to change the clothing before it gets too contaminated.

**Without buttons or external pockets**
 
To prevent physical contamination – buttons can fall off if not securely fastened and pockets encourage food handlers to carry objects, such as pencils, paperclips or string, into food areas where they could fall into food

### Methods of preservation
After time all foods will decompose due to the action of spoilage micro-organisms. The shelf life of food can be extended by preservation. There are a number of different methods of preservation, but they are all based on the same principle – **to remove one or more of the requirements for bacterial multiplication (food, moisture, warmth and time)**.
