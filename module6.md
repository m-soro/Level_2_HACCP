## Definitions

Food premises must be kept clean since high standards of cleanliness are the key to ensuring food safety. Before we start on the subject of cleaning, it is important to know the exact meaning of certain terms associated with it.

**Cleaning** is the process of making something free of visible dirt.

**Detergent** is a chemical used to dissolve grease and removes dirt

**Disinfectant** is a chemical that is used to reduce micro-organisms on a surface to safe levels. Disinfectants are used after a surface has been cleaned with detergent.
Steam or heat above 82 degrees Celcius can also be used in the process of disinfection.
Disinfection does not necessarily kill all bacteria or spores, but reduces them to a safe level. A disinfectant therfore kills most bacteria and leaves a surface safe to be direct contant with food.

**Sanitizer** is a chemical that both cleans and disinfects in one step. 

## Using cleaning chemicals

There are four rules you need to follow when using any kind of cleaning chemical. There are four rules you need to follow when using any kind of cleaning chemical.

**Follow instructions for use** - always follow manufacturer's instructions
**Use the correct measure** - measure and always use the correct concentration based on the label. Apply it the correct contact time and rinse well when required.
**Never mix chemicals** - never mix sanitizers, disinfectants and chemicals
**Store away from food** - store chemicals in designated area, away from food.

## Cleaning
Cleaning is intended to keep food and workplaces safe.

By cleaning you can:

* protect food from contamination
* control the risks associated with bacterial multiplication
* avoid attracting pests
* prevent accidents and injury from slips and trips
* create a good impression
* comply with the law to keep food safe.

Even if something looks clean it could still be contaminated because you cannot see pathogenic bacteria with the naked eye. Therefore, it is important to clean and disinfect or sanitize certain surfaces and items frequently throughout the working day.

## To clean or disinfect

**Food-contact surfaces**

Food-contact surfaces must be cleaned and disinfected or sanitized. These include:

* chopping boards, preparation tables, work surfaces
* utensils such as knives, tongs and tasting spoons
* food processing equipment such as slicers and mixers
* fridges – inside and out.

Fridges require regular cleaning and disinfection because they are used to store high-risk food. Cleaning and disinfection will ensure that surfaces are clean and unlikely to harbour any spoilage or pathogenic micro-organisms that could contaminate food. All the food should be removed and relocated to an alternative fridge whilst cleaning takes place. The detailed procedures for cleaning the fridge should be outlined on a cleaning schedule.

**Hand-contact surfaces**

Hand-contact surfaces should be cleaned and disinfected or sanitized. These include:

* handles (of doors, fridges, freezers, cupboards and drawers)
* taps
* switches
* pens and pencils
* telephones (if they must be in the kitchen).

**Cleaning equipment, waste bins and other areas**

Certain items need to be cleaned and disinfected or sanitized because they are likely to harbour a lot of bacteria. These include:

* cloths and mops
* waste bins and their lids
* splash backs of sinks and the upstands at the back of work surfaces.
 
## Surfaces that need cleaning only

Surfaces and items that are not food-contact or hand-contact surfaces or are not items that pose significant contamination or bacterial multiplication risks, can usually be cleaned using a detergent only. These include floors, walls, ceilings, doors, cupboards and shelves.
 
It is good practice to:
* Clean food storage areas regularly
* Store food off the floor and away from the walls (access for cleaning should be straightforward)
* Sweep up any spillages and then clean with an appropriate floor cleaning chemical. (This should be diluted to the correct concentration and left for a specific contact time. Some floor cleaners will require rinsing and others are safe to be left to dry with no rinse. Always follow the manufacturer’s instructions.)

## Wet cleaning and disinfection
The process of wet cleaning and disinfection can be used to clean and disinfect utensils and equipment that cannot be put in the dishwasher. The process of wet cleaning and disinfection involves six stages.

	
Stage 1: **Prepare**. Remove loose and heavy dirt.
Stage 2: **Clean**. Wash with hot water and detergent.
Stage 3: **Rinse**. Rinse with clean hot water to remove any traces of detergent or dirt.
Stage 4: **Disinfect**. Use chemical disinfectant and leave it on for the correct contact time.
The clean, rinse and disinfect stages can be combined into one stage if a sanitizer is used.
Stage 5: **Rinse**. Give a final rinse with clean, hot water.
Stage 6: **Dry**. If possible, leave items to dry naturally in the air.

## Cleaning chemicals

All cleaning chemicals should be used according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For this reason, it is a good idea to keep them in their original containers, unless the instructions say something different.

Many cleaning chemicals are supplied in the correct concentration for use immediately, for example disinfecting or sanitizing solutions sprayed directly onto surfaces.

In larger catering businesses, you may use concentrated chemicals that require dilution. It is very important to ensure that these are diluted exactly as the instructions require. If they are too weak, they may not be effective and if they are too strong, they can corrode equipment, burn hands and leave chemical residues.

When cleaning, always ensure that food is out of the way before you start.

## Cloths

Cloths are a common source of contamination. For this reason, single-use, disposable cloths are recommended. If these are not available, you need to make sure that the cloths you do use are clean and fit for purpose. Different types of cloths should be used for different types of jobs. These are often colour coded to help food handlers use the right cloth for the right job.

**Holding hot items** - Use a chefs’ cloth for holding hot items.
**Polishing cutlery, crockery and glassware** - Use a tea towel or glass cloth.
**Washing up** - Use a dish cloth for washing up dishes.
**Wiping food or hand contact surfaces** - Use single-use disposable cloths for wiping:
* work surfaces
* hands
* the sides of dishes before serving. 

## Cleaning schedules and cleaning records

Cleaning schedules describe cleaning tasks to be completed at regular intervals, not those covered by ‘clean as you go’ activities. The food business operator is responsible for drawing up the cleaning schedule. Sometimes, in larger businesses the cleaning chemical supplier will help with drawing up the cleaning schedules.

As a food handler, you will be responsible for completing the tasks described within the cleaning schedule.

* A cleaning schedule describes what needs to be cleaned, when, how and by whom
* A cleaning record is used to help staff and management keep track of what has been cleaned, when, how and by whom to ensure that cleaning is carried out to the correct standards.

## What is on a cleaning schedule?

* **What needs to be cleaned?** - Everything that needs to be cleaned must be listed in the schedule - from food preparation surfaces and equipment to floors and walls. It is important that all parts of the food premises are covered. 

* **When will it need to be cleaned?** - The cleaning schedule will show how frequently cleaning tasks should be carried out - for example chopping boards to be cleaned and disinfected after every use, floor to be cleaned at the end of every shift and disinfected weekly. 

* **Who will do the cleaning?** - Depending on the task, this could be a designated person, everyone working in a specific part of the operation or an outside contractor. The name of the person responsible for checking that the task has been carried out in accordance with the instructions will also be included. 

* **How will cleaning be carried out?** - The cleaning schedule will include a description of the cleaning method, the chemicals and equipment(for example, disposable cloth, nylon brush, floor scrubbing machine, etc.) that should be used, any safety precautions that nned to be taken and any protective clothing or equipment that need to be used. It should also include an indication of the time required to carry out the task.  

## Cleaning intervals

As you have seen, cleaning schedules describe cleaning tasks to be completed at regular intervals. These are tasks that are not covered by the normal ‘clean as you go’ activity during the working day.

It is not possible to give a complete list of what requires cleaning when (that is, on a daily, weekly or monthly basis) because all food businesses are different. For example, cleaning tasks might be different in the cleaning schedules for a small café and a large hospital kitchen. The frequency of cleaning should be determined by an assessment of food safety risks and good practice guidelines.

In catering businesses it is, however, common for food preparation tables, sinks, splash backs and food equipment to thoroughly cleaned and disinfected daily. Similarly for the inside of fridges to be cleaned weekly and for ceilings to be cleaned monthly or even every two to three months.

## Washing facilities and dealing with waste

Managing waste

There are three key points to remember about waste:	
* It builds up quickly
* It is a significant source of contamination
* It attracts pests.

**Waste removal**

Waste builds up rapidly – so make sure that you:
* empty bins as soon as they are full
* do not allow the rubbish to build up – it should be collected from the premises regularly (products of animal origin may need specialist waste contractors to collect them).

Waste such as cardboard, clean packaging materials and paper does not have to be stored in closed containers. However it should be stored so that it is not a physical contamination risk to food.

**Avoiding contamination**

Bins and waste are significant sources of contamination and should be dealt with accordingly. 
 
To help to reduce the risks:
* clean all waste areas regularly and thoroughly
* always wash your hands after handling waste.

**Reducing the risk of pest infestation**

Pests will be attracted to waste areas and you should make sure that they cannot get in. 

Waste should be kept in containers that are pest proof. 

To ensure that flies and other pests are not attracted to waste materials:
* use bins with tight-fitting lids
* change the liners every time the bin is emptied, and at least every day (it is good practice to ensure that bins are left empty and clean overnight)
* clean bins regularly
* keep the lids on the bins closed at all times.


## Washing hands, food and equipment
The thorough washing of hands, food and equipment is critical to food safety. 

Food businesses are required by law to provide proper facilities for each of these.

**Washing hands**

Food businesses are required by law to provide hand wash facilities with:

* Hot and cold running water
* Soap
* Hygienic drying facilities.

These should be located in a place that is conveniently accessible to food handlers.

**Washing food and equipment**

Food businesses are required by law to provide sinks for washing equipment. These sinks must have hot and cold running water. In addition, the food business must have separate sinks for washing food. The food sink must have hot and/or cold water, depending upon the type of food handled. 

In very small businesses, the same sink could be used, provided that the two activities are not carried out at the same time and the sinks are thoroughly cleaned and disinfected between activities. A separate hand wash basin is, however, still required.

## Suitability of premises

Food premises must be suitable for the type of food being prepared. 

The structure of and equipment in food businesses must be clean and easy to keep clean. This will help control the danger of contamination.

### Design and construction**

**Design**

* The design, construction and equipping of food premises must minimise the risk of contamination
* The design of food premises, including the positioning of equipment, should enable staff to clean easily and thoroughly
* The design of food premises should allow food to move through the kitchen from the delivery and preparation of raw ingredients through to finished dishes being ready for service without any back-tracking, especially through vegetable preparation and washing-up areas.

**Construction**

The best materials for the structure of food premises are hard-wearing, waterproof, smooth and easy to clean.

### Facilities

To ensure food safety, food premises must have good lighting and ventilation and hot water basins for hand washing must be provided in the toilet area and there must also be at least one easily accessible hand wash basin in food preparation areas.

* Hand wash basins must be separate from any sinks for washing food or washing up.

All basins should have:
* Hot and cold running water
* Soap (preferably liquid soap)
* Hygienic drying facilities (preferably disposable paper towels).

### Equipment

Food equipment and utensils should be made from materials that are hard-wearing, waterproof, smooth, easy to clean, and resistant to cracking/chipping.

## First aid and the law
The law requires businesses to have adequate and appropriate first-aid equipment, facilities and personnel on site to enable first aid to be given when needed.
 
**First-aid requirements for smaller businesses**
In smaller businesses, a person should be appointed to take charge of the first-aid kit and call an ambulance if needed.
 
**First-aid requirements for larger businesses**
Larger businesses may need to appoint one or more qualified first aiders, depending on the size of the business and the risks.
 
**First aider**
A first aider will be a member of staff who has attended an approved training course and holds a current certificate. 

## What goes into a first-aid kit?

The most likely injuries in kitchens are:
Minor and deep cuts, burns and scalds, slips, trips and falls, and sprains or strains.
The first-aid kit should be equipped to help treat these where appropriate.

* **First aid guidance card** - combines advice on basic first aid and a list of the contents of the first aid box.
* **Adhesive dressings** - Individually wrapped sterile, adhesive, waterproof dressings to cover minor cuts or sores. These should be brightly colored(blue) so that they are easy to see if they fall into food. 
* **Sterile eye pads** - in case something gets in the eye. 
* **Triangular bandages** - Individually wrapped triangular bandages in case someone injures their arm or wrist or for use as a presure bandage.
* **Safety pins** - for use with bandages but be careful, the could cause contamination of food.
* **Wound dressing** - Individually wrapped sterile, unmedicated dressings for wounds. 
* **Disposable gloves** - Sterile disposable gloves to protect the first aider from infection.

## Common food pests, infestation and pest control

A food pest is any creature that lives on, or in, food. Food pests can cause damage or contamination or both. 

## The attraction of food premises

Food premises are attractive to pests because they contain everything most pests need to survive.

* **Food** - Pests thrive where they can find food – in storage, preparation or as waste.
* **Moisture** - Pests thrive where they can find moisture – such as condensation from cooking activities, from dripping taps or water leaks or stored liquids.
* **Warmth** - Pests thrive where they can find warmth – such as from heating systems, ovens and fridge motors.
* **Shelter** - Pests thrive where they can find shelter – quiet, undisturbed, dark spaces are good for sleeping and nesting. Infestations are, therefore, common in false ceilings, boiler rooms and little-used storage areas.

## Why do we need to control pests?

It is important to prevent an infestation of food pests because they:

* transmit disease
* contaminate food with their bodies, hair, faeces, urine, etc
* damage the structure of the premises and equipment.

## Signs of pest infestation

Any sign of an infestation should be reported immediately to your supervisor or manager. 

Signs of a pest infestation include:
* live or dead bodies
* droppings
* eggs, larvae or pupae
* feathers or fur
* nesting material.

**Damage**

Signs of a pest infestation include:
* spilled food
* torn or damaged packaging
* gnawed pipes, cables, fittings, bricks, etc.

**Smells and sounds**

Signs of a pest infestation include:
* unusual smells
* scratching, pecking or gnawing sounds.

**Tracks and trails**

Signs of a pest infestation include:
* paw or claw prints or scratches
* smears and ‘rat runs’.

Pest infestations can lead to a food business being, taken to court fined, and possibly forced to close down.

## Principles of prevention

Pest infestation can lead to multiple problems. To prevent infestation, remember to:
* keep the workplace clean
* cover food at all times
* store food off the floor and in pest-proof containers
* check deliveries carefully
* check regularly for signs of an infestation
* rotate stock
* keep well-fitting lids on bins
* keep door and window screens closed.

## Prevention and eradication

Once pests are detected, they must be eliminated from the food business. A pest control contractor will know how best to monitor for pests, pest-proof food premises and how to treat an infestation. Pest control should only be carried out by a qualified and competent person. Different types of pests require different methods to control them. 

There are three broad types of pest control that can be employed:

* environmental to prevent infestation in the first place and
* physical and chemical methods that can be employed to get rid of pests should they get into to food premises.

For your own safety and that of others, you must not touch or interfere with any pest control measures or equipment.

* **Environmental control - prevention** - Good design, maintenance, housekeeping and proofing will all help to prevent pest infestation.

* **Physical eradication methods** - When physical methods are used, the pest is caught and removed so the risk of food contamination is eliminated. Physical eradication methods include:

* traps
* sticky boards
* electrocuting fly and mouse killers
* sticky fly papers
* shooting.

Care should be taken when positioning pest control products to prevent contamination.

* **Chemical methods of eradication** - When chemicals are used, the pests do not die immediately and may contaminate food if precautions are not taken. The use of chemicals must be carefully controlled to prevent chemical contamination of food. 


Chemical methods of eradication include:

* **rodenticides** – baits set down to poison mice and rats
* **insecticides** – sprays may be used for insect control, providing all food is protected from contamination.
