## Role and power of food enforcement officers
Every food business must comply with certain rules and regulations when handling, preparing and selling food. These rules and regulations are called food safety laws. 

The enforcement of food safety law is carried out by officers who are employed by the food authority, usually a local authority. 

An enforcement officer is authorised to:

* provide food safety advice
* inspect food premises
* enforce food safety law.

## The role of enforcement officers

This is an enforcement officer specialising in food safety and they work for the local authority. They visit all types of premises that produce or sell food.

### Kitchen checks
The enforcement officer checks that business operators are storing, preparing, cooking and serving food in a safe and hygienic way.

### Staff checks
They also check that kitchen staff are wearing suitable protective clothing, have high levels of personal hygiene and are adequately trained.

### Management checks
There should also be a documented food safety management system in place.
If this is not up to standard, the enforcement officer will provide advice or, in more serious cases, look to take further action.

### The powers of enforcement officers include:
* entering food businesses and inspecting premises and food
* serving notices and obtaining orders
* removing suspect food and having it destroyed if it is considered unsafe to eat.

## Notices and Orders

Let’s take a look at some of the notices served on a food business and orders that can be obtained by enforcement officers.

### Hygiene Improvement Notice
A Hygiene Improvement Notice is used to require food businesses to improve something substandard, such as a broken tap or an inadequate food safety management system.

### Hygiene Emergency Prohibition Notice
A Hygiene Emergency Prohibition Notice can apply to:

* premises – for example, to stop the use of premises when there is a pest infestation
* part of premises – for example, to stop the use of a food store without a proper roof
* equipment – for example, to stop the use of a griddle that is not working properly.

### Prohibition Order
A Hygiene Emergency Prohibition Notice can apply to:

* premises – for example, to stop the use of premises when there is a pest infestation
* part of premises – for example, to stop the use of a food store without a proper roof
* equipment – for example, to stop the use of a griddle that is not working properly.

## Penalties

The penalties for non-compliance include:
* being stopped from using part or all of a business premises
* being stopped from running a food business
* fines, legal costs and compensation
* a criminal record
* imprisonment, in extreme cases.

## Supervision, instruction and training

Food handlers must receive adequate supervision, instruction and /or training in food hygiene. The extent of the supervision, instruction or training required depends, to a large extent, on the role and responsibilities of the food handler. The higher the level of responsibility the higher the level of training that is required. 

In addition, those responsible for the development of food safety management procedures should receive adequate training in the application of HACCP principles.
 
**Refresher Training**: It is important to keep up to date with any changes in the law and the latest food safety best practice. Food safety updates should be provided as the need arises and it is generally recommended that refresher training should take place at least every three years.
Training records should be completed to show who has been trained and what has been covered.

## Food Handlers and the Law

* Keep yourself clean - must have highest standards when it comes to personal cleanliness. Should arrive at work clean and tidy and remain clean and tidy throughout the shift.
* Keep the workplace clean  - should clear up and clean as you go throughout the shift to control the risks from food safety hazards(contamination) and health and safety hazards(slips and trips).
* Protect food from contamination or anything that could cause harm - should be alert to food safety hazards and take steps to control the risks of harm being caused. 
* Wear appropriate clothing - must wear clean over clothing and where, appropriate, protective clothing provided by their employers. 
* Inform your employer immediately if you are suffering from or are a carrier of bacteria or virsues known to cause food poisoning. - it is against the law for you to work as a food handler. 

## Importance of record keeping
Records are needed to show that points in the preparation and sale of food, which are critical to safety, are being controlled. 

Accurate and detailed records help to ensure that the business complies with the law and provide evidence of how food is handled.

The type of records kept by a food business might include:
* refrigeration temperatures
* cooking and hot holding temperatures
* cleaning
* staff training
* pest control
* deliveries (temperature and condition)
* traceability.

## What is ‘due diligence’?

Food business operators must be able to demonstrate that they have taken all reasonable precautions to prepare and serve food that is safe to eat. 

This is called showing ‘**due diligence**’, and it can be used as a defence by a food business accused of breaking food safety law.
 
For example, it is a legal requirement for a food business to have food safety management procedures based on HACCP principles. To demonstrate ‘due diligence’, a business would need to demonstrate how these procedures work in practice. The food business operator would need, therefore, to provide evidence of record keeping, monitoring procedures, cleaning schedules, staff training, etc.
